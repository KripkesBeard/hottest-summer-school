# HoTTEST Summer School 2022

This is a repository for my notes and code completed during the 
[HoTTEST Summer School program](https://uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest_summer_school_2022.html) 
hosted by Western University during the summer of 2022.

The program was an introduction to homotopy type theory, and it covered topics relating to formalization of mathematics in
dependently typed functional programming languages,specifically Agda, and some category theory.

## Structure

    - [Homework]()

* [notes]()

## N.B.

I cloned the 
[HoTT Game repo](https://github.com/thehottgame/TheHoTTGame)
and the 
[Summer School's repo](https://github.com/martinescardo/HoTTEST-Summer-School)
in order to have all of the homework code locally. All copyright and 
credit goes to the original authors, of course, and the only changes I
made were removing the example solutions to some of the homework, 
removing some of the build files, for example the nix files for the 
HoTT Game, and putting some of these N.B.'s saying the same things 
throughout the READMEs. Thank you, so much, to all of the organizers, 
presenters,TAs, and everyone else who made this summer school possible.

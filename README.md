# HoTTEST Summer School 2022

This is a repository for my notes and code completed during the 
[HoTTEST Summer School program](https://uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest_summer_school_2022.html) 
hosted by Western University during the summer of 2022.

The program was an introduction to homotopy type theory and the formalization of mathematics in a
dependently typed functional programming language. We used Agda 2.6.2.2 as the language, and
the Cubical Agda library for HoTT.

    - [Worksheets](https://github.com/KripkesBeard/hottest-summer-school/tree/master/HoTT/Worksheets)

## N.B.

In order to get the homework to typecheck, I had to locally clone the 
[Summer School's repo](https://github.com/martinescardo/HoTTEST-Summer-School). 
For the exercises, I copied the questions into new Agda files and solved the
exercises. All copyright, of course, remains with the original authors. Thank 
you to all of the organizers, instructors, TAs, and everyone else who helped
make this happen!

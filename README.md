# HoTTEST Summer School 2022

This is a repository for my notes and code completed during the 
[HoTTEST Summer School program](https://uwo.ca/math/faculty/kapulkin/seminars/hottest_summer_school_2022.html) 
hosted by Western University during the summer of 2022.

The program was an introduction to homotopy type theory and formalization of mathematics in a
dependently typed functional programming languages, specifically Agda.

## N.B.

In order to get the homework to typecheck, I had to locally clone the 
[Summer School's repo](https://github.com/martinescardo/HoTTEST-Summer-School). 
For the exercises, I copied the completed files into this repo so that I could
upload them. All copyright, of course, stays with the original authors of those 
files, I merely solved the exercises.

# Agda

Collection of agda code written for the summer school program.

For the summer school, we used 
[Agda 2.6.2.2](https://github.com/agda/agda/releases/tag/v2.6.2.2), 
with 
[The Agda Standard Library 1.7.1](https://github.com/agda/agda-stdlib/releases/tag/v1.7.1)
and 
[The Cubical Agda Library 0.4](https://github.com/agda/cubical). 
(I actually don't know if it's 0.4, technically we just used the most recent
version which hasn't been numbered yet, but since the last was 0.3, I assume
once this one is versioned it will be 0.4.)

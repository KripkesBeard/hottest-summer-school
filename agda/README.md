## Cheat Sheet

A cheat sheet for Agda (insofar as it pretains to my set up, which is on Windows using VSCode):

### Commands

C-c C-l - Typecheck your file
C-c C-n - Normalize an expression

### Libraries

The modules that come with Agda (i.e., builtin and primitive, **not** the standard library) start
with an \<Agda.\> prefix.

The standard library modules do not have a \<Stdlib.\> prefix or anything like that.

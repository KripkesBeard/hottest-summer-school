# Exercises

This is the folder for the exercises/labwork/everything
else going along with the lectures on Agda. I have a
local git clone of the 
[summer school repo](https://github.com/martinescardo/HoTTEST-Summer-School)
which has all of the notes and homework as an Agda library,
and that's necessary to actually get the homework to run.
But because I don't want to upload all of that, I am just
copying the finished homework files into this directory,
and also changing their file and module names slightly
(adding a 0 in front of the name), so that they don't
conflict with the source copies. In order to
get these to typecheck, you need to also have a local
copy of the summer school repo, tell Agda where
it's located, and to load it by default.
